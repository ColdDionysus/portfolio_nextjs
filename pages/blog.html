        <h2>How technology has affected students in their daily lives?</h2>
        <p >
            Children these days aren’t referred to as “digital natives” without reason. In fact, a report from Common Sense Media revealed that, in 2017, 42% of young children had their very own tablet—up from 7% in 2013 and less than 1% in 2011. At the same time, the average amount of time children spend with these handheld devices each day is skyrocketing, from 5 minutes a day in 2011, to 15 minutes a day in 2013, to 48 minutes a day in 2017. <br>It’s no secret that technology has become an integral component of daily life. In particular, it’s become rare to see children and teens without a digital device in hand wherever we go: restaurants, waiting rooms, parks and more. <br>However, the rapid pace by which toddlers, children, and teens are adopting technology into their daily lives has many questioning the effects it can have on their development. Although the negative impacts of technology frequently hit the news and are popular topics of conversation, technology is also being used more and more in educational settings, like the classroom. This leaves many of us wondering: is technology all bad?<br>
